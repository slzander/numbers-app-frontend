## Welcome to Write and Count!
**This app encourages kids to practice writing numbers and counting. Write and Count uses a pre-trained model that extracts features of an image to classify it according to the model.**

Created by Stacey Zander.

To Play:

1. Draw a number (1 - 10) on a white piece of paper or whiteboard and hold it up to the camera. The model recognizes numbers best when the number fills the field of view of the camera.

2. When the number you drew shows up on the button below the video screen, press it.

3. Scroll through the displayed number cards, add to and delete from your favorites, and practice counting. 

4. Draw all 10 numbers to collect more cards. Enjoy!
